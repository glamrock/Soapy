  * Attempt to do the same for for CAcert
  * Fixes to: Reddit, Drupal.org
  * Disable some problematic rulesets: Cisco, Opera

    efficient

    some parts of NYTimes, Facebook, and other sites
    (closes: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2217)

0.9.1:
  * Unbreak the "all x news articles" links in Google News
  * Exclude nytimes.com/roomfordebate, since it's broken in https.

0.9.0:
  * This is our "Firesheep" release.  It has numerous anti-firesheep
    improvements!
  * Split the stricter parts of the Facebook rule into a "Facebook+" rule.
    It's what's required to protect Facebook from Firesheep and similar cookie
    theft attacks, but it may break apps, because apps.facebook.com currently 
    has the wrong cert.
  * Allow rulesets to specify that the secure flag should be set on some
    cookies even if the site operator failed to do so
  * Ship rules for:
    - Amazon S3 (AWS)
    - Github
    - Bit.ly
    - Dropbox
    - Evernote
    - Cisco
  * Extensive improvements (including secure cookies) in the Twitter and
    Facebook rules
  * Support for full Live / Hotmail encryption
  * Significant performance optimisation decreases CPU load
    Fixes:
    https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1656
    https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2194
  * Rearrange our Channel Replacement code!
    Fixes https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1684
          https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548102
    Thanks to Giorgio Maone and Boris Zbarsky!
  * Add scrollbars if there are a lot of rules present in the Preferences
    dialog (may still be somewhat buggy...)
  * Optimise GoogleServices.xml and support Google code search
  * Patch for future compatiability with Request Policy:
    https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1574

0.2.2:
  * Fix a glitch in the Content Policy path that may or may not have been
    responsible for these bugs:
      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1700
      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1672
      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1673
    The patch breaks toolbar search suggestions.  And who knows what else?
  * Don't send some country homepages to https://www.google.com/webhp?hl= ; 
    use https://encrypted.google.com instead
  * Cleanup and refactor the URI replacement and rewriting code.  Should
    hopefully fix https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1649
  * Add a Google APIs rule
  * Remove some Extremely Nasty code that would delete malformed rulesets (!)
    (it was pasted from Torbutton's cookie handling logic...)
  * Add code.google.com to Google Services
  * The client=firefox* workaround is no longer necessary once we're sending
    non-US users to encrypted.google.com rather than www.google.com
  * Better coverage for GMX, Google services, Twitter
  * Scroogle homepage in HTTPS
  * Add rules for
    - Mail.com logins
    - Microsoft (limited coverage)
  * Fix a nasty Google/Wikipedia bug within 0.2.2.development.{1,2}

0.2.1:
  * Although google said https://www.google.com would continue to work, that
    wasn't absolutely true.
  * The new encyrpted.google.com seems to require queries to be #q=thing
    rather than search?q=thing, at least some of the time.  So let's do that.

0.2.0:
  * Work around the fact that Google does not allow client=firefox* HTTPS
    searches from outside the US, by rewriting those URIs
  * Add rules for:
    - Amazon
    - GMX
    - Live.com (Hotmail logins)
    - Meebo
    - the Netherlands Government
    - Wordpress.com
    - Zoho
  * Remove the assumption that non-US searches would always start with an hl=
    language parameter
  * Handle searches to the google.com/firefox script better
  * Remove accidental duplicates of a couple of rules!
  * Bump maxVersion into the future so we're compatible with Firefox alphas
  * Fix more legacy eff.org bugs

0.1.2:
  * Apparently, we are not actually compatible with Firefox 2.0.0.x, so don't
    install with it!
  * Further generalisation of Wikimedia rules
  * Fix bugs in the handling of obscure parts of eff.org and torproject.org
  * A bug in a user rules file should produce an error, rather than causing all
    rules to fail to load

0.1.1:
  * Generalise the Wikipedia rules to other Wikimedia services
  * In preferences window, add a link to instructions for writing one's own
    rules
